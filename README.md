This is a Tic Tac Toe game. The goal was to practice DOM manipulation, game logic, and clean code structuring without using any external libraries or frameworks.

The game supports two-player turns, checks for win and draw conditions, and includes a reset button to start a new game. It demonstrates basic interactive UI handling and separation of logic from presentation.
